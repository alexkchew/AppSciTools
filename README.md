# AppSciTools
This repository stores useful plotting tools and functions that could help an Application Scientist. It could be embedded into multiple projects and iteratively updated to have the most up-to-date tools.

# Usage
You could add these tools as a submodule to an application that you are working on. To add as a submodule:
`git submodule add git@github.com:alexkchew/AppSciTools.git scripts/AppSciTools`

Then, update submodules after cloning:
`git submodule update --init`
